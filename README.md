# Business Data Analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end business data analysis workflow using Python. It focuses on transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights through structured data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and clear business-oriented interpretation.

The analysis emphasizes not just revenue growth, but profitability, regional performance, and the impact of discounting on business outcomes.
